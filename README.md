# Math Quiz Game in Assembly

This is a simple math quiz game written in Assembly language. The game challenges you to solve mathematical equations within a limited number of lives. It is designed to run in a DOS environment and requires DosBox or a similar DOS emulator to work on modern systems.

## Features
- **Math Equations**: Solve randomly generated math problems.
- **Limited Lives**: You start with 3 lives. Lose a life for every incorrect answer.
- **Simple Interface**: Clean and straightforward text-based interface.
- **DOS Compatibility**: Designed to run in a DOS environment.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need:
- **DosBox**: A DOS emulator for modern operating systems. You can download it from [DosBox's official website](https://www.dosbox.com/).
